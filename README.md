# Detect AI generated photo

## Introduction

To access the online version of the project, [click here](http://joaobizzo.pythonanywhere.com/).

This project creates a web application using Flask to detect whether images are generated by artificial intelligence (AI). It accepts image uploads and processes them through a backend API to determine if they are AI-generated. The app provides visual feedback to the user along with a confidence score. The frontend is developed with basic HTML enhanced with Flask template rendering, while the backend is powered by Flask and Flask-WTF for form handling.

## Features

- Upload image files (supports .jpg, .jpeg, .png formats).
- Validates the presence of an image file upon submission.
- Displays results on whether the image is AI-generated, along with a confidence score.
- User-friendly interface with immediate feedback on the upload status.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-WTF
- Werkzeug
- An API or method to analyze the images (referenced as `query` from `main` in the code).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd path_to_directory
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask Flask-WTF Werkzeug
4. Set up environment variables (optional but recommended for production):
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development  # 'development' for debug mode, 'production' for production
5. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

1. **Starting the Application**:
   - Launch the application using the Flask command or Python (as shown in the Setup section). Your terminal will display the local URL, usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Uploading an Image**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Flask.
   - You will see a simple form asking to upload an image file. Click the "Upload file" label or the area around it to open your file browser.
   - Select an image file (.jpg, .jpeg, or .png) and submit it by clicking the "Submit" button.

3. **Processing the Image**:
   - Once an image is uploaded, the application checks if it's in a supported format. If not, it will flash an error message.
   - For supported formats, the image is processed by the `query` function in `main.py`. This function should handle the analysis of whether the image is AI-generated or not.
   - Depending on the API's response, the app will either show a success message with the results or an error message if something goes wrong during processing.

4. **Viewing Results**:
   - If the image is successfully analyzed, you will be redirected to a new page showing whether the image is detected as AI-generated along with the confidence score formatted as a percentage.
   - There are links provided to learn more about the detection model and to try analyzing another image.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If there are any issues during the upload or processing stages, the application will display an appropriate error message, allowing users to understand what went wrong.

## Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the HTML templates, adding CSS for better styling, or altering the backend logic to integrate with different AI models or APIs for image analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical application of Flask in creating an interactive web application for AI-related tasks. It is designed to be simple yet extendable for more complex and robust uses.
